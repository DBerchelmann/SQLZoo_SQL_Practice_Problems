<h2>SQL ZOO PRACTICE PROBLEMS README</h2>

Hi there,

Thank you for visiting this README file. Here is the long and short of it...

This repository is for my practice SQL exercises as we are on break for a couple of weeks from CODE UP.

This repository will hold the practice problems and solutions...nothing more.

Hope you have a great day!
